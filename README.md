# About TinyBasic
Tiny Basic is a BASIC dialect made in 1975 in protest of Bill Gates MS-BASIC interpreter costing $150. Dennis Allison, a Stanford lecturer and member of the famous Homebrew Computer Club, responded by creating the open source Tiny Basic interpreter. 

Many advancements were made upon this free alternative to Gates expensive BASIC, some costing a few dollars, others open source, some even became more well known the Allisonâ€™s own version but Allison will always be known as one of the pioneers of open source languages.

# About the compiler
This compiler is for python 2.7.x to compile TinyBasic into fully functional C programs. The compiler is relying on Peglet for grammar parsing.

This can be used as separately as a parser, interpreter and compiler but obviously the interpreter and compiler rely on the parser. 

The compiler is far from perfect and very buggy but it servers the purpose of a POC of lightweight compiling of old simple languages.

#TODO
Add Functions 

Add FOR loops
